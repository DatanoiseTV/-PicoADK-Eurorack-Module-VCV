Start-point to write your own plugins for the Datanoise Aurora board using the Vult language
and transfer them to the [real hardware](https://github.com/DatanoiseTV/-PicoADK-Eurorack-Module) later on.

## Installing the Vult compiler

In order to modify the Vult code, you need to have the Vult compiler installed. You can download the binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/modlfo/vult/releases) and place them in the project folder or add it to your path.

Alternatively, you can install the Vult compiler using `npm` but this version of the compiler is slower.

```
$ npm install vult -g
```

## Modifying the code

All the code is contained in the file `processor.vult`. This file contains the function `process` that receives four inputs and returns four outputs. Here are a few code examples:

Four Channels Mixer
```
fun process(in1:real, in2:real, in3:real, in4:real) {
   mem param1, param2, param3, param4;
   val out1, out2, out3, out4 = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0;

   // all inputs mixed to out1
   out1 = in1 * param1 + param2 * in2 + param3 * in3 + param4 * in3;

   return out1, out2, out3, out4;
}
```

Simple VCA
```
fun process(in1:real, in2:real, in3:real, in4:real) {
   mem param1, param2, param3, param4;
   val out1, out2, out3, out4 = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0;

   out1 = in1 * in2;

   return out1, out2, out3, out4;
}
```
